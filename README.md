## Built With these Technologies

### Client

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: Javascript library for building User Interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Type-safe code and other advantages!
- **[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com)**: Visual design styles.
- **[ApolloClient](https://www.apollographql.com/client/)**: For handling GraphQL queries + caching + local state management.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: Testing Framework.
- **[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)**: To automatically generate code from your GraphQL schema.

### Server

- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: SQL database.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Type-safe code and other advantages!
- **[ApolloServer](https://www.apollographql.com/server/)**: GraphQLServer.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: Testing Framework.
- **[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)**: To automatically generate code from your GraphQL schema.
- **[GraphQL Modules](https://graphql-modules.com/)**: To create an scalable structure.

## Main objective

I made this project for my final thesis of the [Web Engineering Master from the Madrid Polytechnic University](https://www.etsisi.upm.es/estudios/master/miw/ig). The main objective of it was to **learn how apps are being developed nowadays on software engineering, what are the leading technologies and understand them by using them**.

## Installing

First you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Then after cloning it have a look at [the scripts](https://github.com/reymon359/full-stack-social-site/blob/67a6d509f66612255c0929d170441fe24240db5f/server/db.ts#L45) to set up the database and then run `npm install` in both, the client and the server directories.

In the client directory you will need to create a `.env` file with this variable

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## Available Scripts

You can execute the different commands within each directory (client and server). The commands below must be executed from the root folder.

### `npm run start:all`

  Runs each part (client & server) in development mode.<br />
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser.
    
### `npm run start:server`

Runs the server part of the app.

### `npm run start:client`

Runs the client part of the app.

### `npm run test:all`

  Runs all the app tests.
    
### `npm run test:server`

Runs the server tests.

### `npm run test:client`

Runs the client tests.

## Side Notes
Although the project is far from being finished (no software project is 100% finished) the main objective has been accomplished, so I will probably stop spending time on this and focus in other projects.
